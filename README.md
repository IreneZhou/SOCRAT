Motivation 
--------------
[SOCR](http://socr.umich.edu), Statistics Online Computational Resource has a huge user base who constantly access the educational data present and java tools which use these data to aid in understanding statistics.
As far as the technology is concerned, currently all the applications are written in `java` and are presented as java applets. The reach of these applications is bottlenecked by technology.

Goal
------
The world is going the HTML5 way. Browsers are becoming more powerful. 
We intend to create new framework which will serve users across all platforms. We will be primarily using `CoffeeScript` (compiles to `JavaScript`) for all the computations and presentation. Given the fact that todayâ€™s browsers have powerful javaScript engines (`v8`, `SpiderMonkey`), we will perform all the calculations on the browser with **no server dependency**. File management, database, computation will be performed inside the browser.

 Technologies/Packages
----------------
 [`AngularJS`](http://angularjs.org) 
 [`Brunch`](http://brunch.io) 
 [`CoffeeScript`](http://coffeescript.org/)
 [`HTML5`](http://html5rocks.com/)
 [`Node.js`](http://nodejs.org/) 
 [`Twitter Bootstrap`](twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) 
 [`D3.js`](http://d3js.org) 

Installation
------------
Incase you wish to contribute to the project, please follow these steps to setup your enviroment.
First, Install [nodejs](http://nodejs.org/) and npm if you havent. [gist](https://gist.github.com/isaacs/579814)

Go ahead and clone the repository.

    $> git clone https://github.com/SOCRedu/SOCR-framework.git FOLDER_NAME/

Now, lets install all the dependent node packages for this project. Go into the FOLDER_NAME/ folder and run,

    $> npm install

This will install all the dependencies mentioned in package.json file.

We are almost there! All the dependencies have been installed now. 
    
Start the server! See the application running at localhost:3000!

    $> scripts/server.sh
    
To start unit-test use. Status information will appear in the new browser window. Test runner will log into console.

    $> scripts/test.sh
